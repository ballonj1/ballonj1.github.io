        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <a name="ingredients">
        <ul>
          <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
          <li>2 chicken breasts with skin and backbone, halved crosswise</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons salt, plus more to taste</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
          <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour, for dredging</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
          <li>1 large red bell pepper, chopped</li>
          <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
          <li>3 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
          <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
          <li>1 ( 28-ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice</li>
          <li>3/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons drained capers</li>
          <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano leaves</li>
          <li>1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh basil leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <a name="directions"/>
        <ol>
          <li>Sprinkle the chicken pieces with 1 teaspoon of each salt and pepper. </li>
          <li>Dredge the chicken pieces in the flour to coat lightly.</li>
          <li>In a large heavy saute pan, heat the oil over a medium-high flame.</li>
          <li>Add the chicken pieces to the pan and saute just until brown, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
          <li>If all the chicken does not fit in the pan, saute it in 2 batches. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.</li>
          <li>Add the bell pepper, onion and garlic to the same pan and saute over medium heat until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Season with salt and pepper. Add the wine and simmer until reduced by half, about 3 minutes.</li>
          <li>Add the tomatoes with their juice, broth, capers and oregano. </li>
          <li>Return the chicken pieces to the pan and turn them to coat in the sauce. </li>
          <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer. Continue simmering over medium-low heat until the chicken is just cooked through, about 30 minutes for the breast pieces, and 20 minutes for the thighs.</li>
          <li>Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a platter. If necessary, boil the sauce until it thickens slightly, about 3 minutes.</li>
          <li>Spoon off any excess fat from atop the sauce. Spoon the sauce over the chicken, then sprinkle with the basil and serve.</li>
        </ol>
