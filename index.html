  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Chicken cacciatore may be one of the most perplexing dishes I've ever encountered. As far as I can tell, it doesn't really exist. I know that sounds nuts, because of course chicken cacciatore exists. But, after analyzing dozens upon dozens of recipes, what I've come to realize is that there is no single common thread from one version to the next that we can say clearly defines the dish. There are just a couple of vague givens—namely, the fact that there's always chicken, and it's always braised. But beyond that, there's not much that "cacciatore" means with any certainty.

In Italy, alla cacciatora, as it's called there, describes a dish prepared "hunter-style." It can be made with other meats, like rabbit and pheasant, though chicken is one of the most common choices today, especially in the United States. Most versions in the US include tomato, red bell pepper, and onions, but this doesn't hold true throughout Italy. Garlic and olive oil are in nearly every version I've seen, but then again, they're in almost all other Italian dishes, too, so that's not saying much.

Wine, red or white, is used often enough that one might argue that chicken all'oenologist would be a more appropriate name for the dish, especially given that there's nary a wild ingredient in most cacciatore recipes. After all, what kind of hunter returns from the woods with a chicken, onions, garlic, and tomatoes?

Marcella Hazan, in her Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, offers an explanation for the infinite variations on cacciatore. "Since there has always been a hunter in nearly every Italian household," she writes, "every Italian cook prepares a dish with a claim to that description." That makes sense to me, and it supports my conclusion—there are so many renditions of chicken cacciatore that the term borders on meaninglessness. We might as well call this chicken all'Average Joe...or...Giuseppe, because it's literally whatever the heck the cook wants it to be.

This kind of vagueness can be maddening to some, but I love it because it means I'm free to riff on the dish however I want, and no one can tell me otherwise. You should love it for the same reason, since, as long as it involves braised chicken, chicken cacciatore can be whatever you want, too.

In the end, I decided to give two recipes here: one more in line with a classic Italian-American style, using tomatoes and red peppers; the other with mushrooms. Think of them as two examples of a larger blueprint that you can adapt any way you like.

Let's take a look at that blueprint.</p>
